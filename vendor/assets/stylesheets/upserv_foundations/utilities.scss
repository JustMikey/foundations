// NOTE: if a file path in the rails app matches the file
// path in here for a scss file, then the file here will
// be ignored. That's whay all directories are prefaced with "uf_"
// For some reason the "upserv_foundations" directory is ignored
// so upserv_foundations/components will match app/assets/stylesheets/components
// in the rails app. Rather than prefacing with "uf_" I should duplicate the
// upserv_foundations directory so it's
// upserv_foundations/upserv_foundations/components
// ... idk
// no changes are needed to this file's name nor the require statemens
// in the rails applicaiton.scss file though so that's nice
